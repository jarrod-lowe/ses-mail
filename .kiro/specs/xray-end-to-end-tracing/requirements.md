# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current SES email processing system has partial XRay tracing implementation, but several AWS services in the email processing pipeline do not natively support XRay tracing, creating gaps in end-to-end observability. This feature will implement comprehensive distributed tracing across the entire email-in path, including services that don't natively support XRay, to provide complete visibility into email processing performance, failures, and bottlenecks.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want complete end-to-end XRay tracing for the email processing pipeline, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor performance across all components.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email is received by SES THEN a trace SHALL be initiated and propagated through the entire processing pipeline
2. WHEN the trace passes through services that don't support XRay natively THEN custom instrumentation SHALL bridge the tracing gaps
3. WHEN viewing XRay traces THEN I SHALL see the complete flow from SES receipt to final email delivery or bounce
4. WHEN a processing step fails THEN the failure SHALL be captured in the XRay trace with error details

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want XRay tracing to include custom annotations and metadata for email processing, so that I can filter and analyze traces based on email characteristics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN an email is processed THEN the trace SHALL include annotations for message ID, sender, recipients, and routing decisions
2. WHEN viewing traces THEN I SHALL be able to filter by email domain, routing action, and processing status
3. WHEN analyzing performance THEN I SHALL see timing breakdowns for each processing stage
4. WHEN troubleshooting THEN I SHALL see email metadata and routing decisions in trace details

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a system operator, I want XRay tracing to work across services that don't natively support tracing, so that I have visibility into the complete email processing flow.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emails flow through SES THEN trace context SHALL be preserved and propagated to SNS
2. WHEN messages pass through SQS queues THEN trace context SHALL be maintained across queue boundaries
3. WHEN EventBridge Pipes processes messages THEN trace context SHALL be preserved through enrichment
4. WHEN EventBridge routes messages THEN trace context SHALL be maintained to handler queues

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a monitoring engineer, I want XRay traces to integrate with CloudWatch metrics and alarms, so that I can correlate tracing data with operational metrics.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN trace data is collected THEN it SHALL be available for CloudWatch Insights queries
2. WHEN creating alarms THEN I SHALL be able to use XRay metrics for error rates and latency thresholds
3. WHEN analyzing trends THEN I SHALL see trace statistics in CloudWatch dashboards
4. WHEN investigating incidents THEN I SHALL be able to correlate traces with CloudWatch logs and metrics

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious administrator, I want XRay tracing to be configurable and cost-effective, so that I can balance observability needs with operational costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN configuring tracing THEN I SHALL be able to set sampling rates to control costs
2. WHEN traces are collected THEN sampling SHALL be consistent across the entire pipeline
3. WHEN reviewing costs THEN XRay usage SHALL be monitored and reported
4. WHEN needed THEN I SHALL be able to adjust tracing levels without system downtime
