# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature provides an outbound email sending system that leverages Amazon SES's SMTP interface to allow users to configure Gmail (or other email clients) to send emails through SES. The system will use SES's built-in SMTP server and provide the necessary AWS infrastructure, credentials, and configuration documentation. The system must be serverless to avoid standing costs and integrate with the existing AWS infrastructure.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As an email user, I want to configure my Gmail client to send emails through SES SMTP with proper credentials, so that I can send emails through our AWS infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL provide SES SMTP endpoint configuration details
2. WHEN the system generates SMTP credentials THEN they SHALL be valid for SES SMTP authentication
3. WHEN documentation is provided THEN it SHALL include step-by-step Gmail configuration instructions
4. WHEN a user follows the configuration THEN Gmail SHALL successfully connect to SES SMTP on port 587 with TLS

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want SES to be properly configured to accept and send emails, so that emails are delivered reliably through AWS infrastructure.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN SES SHALL be configured with appropriate sending domains
2. WHEN SES receives SMTP messages THEN it SHALL process them according to configured policies
3. WHEN emails are sent THEN SES SHALL handle delivery, bounces, and complaints appropriately
4. WHEN SES encounters issues THEN appropriate notifications SHALL be configured

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a cost-conscious administrator, I want the system to use only serverless AWS resources, so that there are no standing monthly or hourly costs.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN designing the architecture THEN the system SHALL NOT use EC2, ECS, RDS, or other resources with standing costs
2. WHEN implementing the solution THEN the system SHALL use only pay-per-use services like Lambda, API Gateway, and SES
3. WHEN the system is idle THEN it SHALL incur zero costs
4. WHEN processing emails THEN costs SHALL be based only on actual usage

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want SES SMTP credentials to be managed securely, so that only authorized users can send emails through the system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating SMTP credentials THEN the system SHALL generate IAM users with minimal required permissions
2. WHEN storing credentials THEN the system SHALL encrypt and store them in DynamoDB
3. WHEN credentials are accessed THEN they SHALL be retrievable by authorized administrators only
4. WHEN credentials are rotated THEN the system SHALL support credential updates without service interruption
5. WHEN encrypting credentials THEN the system SHALL use AWS KMS for encryption at rest

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the system to integrate with the existing AWS account and infrastructure, so that it leverages existing security and monitoring capabilities.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN deploying the system THEN it SHALL be deployed in the same AWS account as existing infrastructure
2. WHEN processing emails THEN the system SHALL use existing IAM roles and policies where appropriate
3. WHEN logging events THEN the system SHALL integrate with existing CloudWatch logging
4. WHEN monitoring performance THEN the system SHALL provide metrics through CloudWatch

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want SES SMTP to be configured to work reliably with standard email clients like Gmail, so that users can send emails without issues.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN SES SMTP is configured THEN it SHALL accept connections on port 587 with STARTTLS
2. WHEN clients connect THEN SES SHALL support standard SMTP AUTH mechanisms
3. WHEN processing messages THEN SES SHALL handle standard SMTP protocol correctly
4. WHEN responding to clients THEN SES SHALL return appropriate SMTP response codes
5. WHEN rate limits apply THEN SES SHALL enforce them according to AWS account limits

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive monitoring and logging for email sending, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor usage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN emails are sent through SES THEN the system SHALL log sending events to CloudWatch
2. WHEN bounces or complaints occur THEN the system SHALL capture and log these events
3. WHEN monitoring usage THEN the system SHALL provide metrics on email volume and success rates
4. WHEN troubleshooting issues THEN detailed logs SHALL be available for analysis
5. WHEN alerts are needed THEN the system SHALL support configurable notifications for important events

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive documentation for all external security-related settings, so that I can properly configure DNS records and security settings for reliable email delivery.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the system THEN documentation SHALL include all required DNS records (SPF, DKIM, DMARC)
2. WHEN configuring domains THEN documentation SHALL provide step-by-step domain verification instructions
3. WHEN implementing security THEN documentation SHALL cover MTA-STS and TLS-RPT setup
4. WHEN troubleshooting delivery THEN documentation SHALL include common DNS configuration issues and solutions
5. WHEN monitoring reputation THEN documentation SHALL explain how to monitor domain and IP reputation

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want comprehensive tracing and logging for all system operations, so that I can troubleshoot issues and monitor system performance effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Lambda functions execute THEN they SHALL emit X-Ray traces for all operations
2. WHEN processing SMTP credentials THEN the system SHALL log detailed operation steps
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL log structured error information with correlation IDs
4. WHEN integrating with AWS services THEN X-Ray SHALL trace service calls and performance
5. WHEN troubleshooting THEN logs SHALL include sufficient context for root cause analysis
